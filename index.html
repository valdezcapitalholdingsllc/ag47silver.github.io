      <h2>Why Silver</h2>
      <p>
        Silver is both a monetary metal and a critical industrial resource.
        It is essential for electronics, solar energy, medical applications,
        and national defense — while also serving as a hedge against currency
        debasement and systemic risk.

      <h2>Critical Mineral Status</h2>
      <p>
        Silver (Ag) is increasingly recognized as a critical mineral due to its
        irreplaceable role in advanced technology, energy infrastructure, and
        supply-chain security.

      <h2>AG47 Thesis</h2>
      <p>
        AG47 represents the convergence of physical scarcity, monetary history,
        and industrial necessity. As demand accelerates and supply constraints
        tighten, silver’s strategic importance continues to grow.
